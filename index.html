			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<div class="myface floatleft">
				<div class="cf">
				<img class="floatle" src="images/jason-face.jpg" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				My name is Jason Siefken, and I am a professional mathematician who focuses
				on dynamical systems and mathematics education.  I earned my PhD from the University
				of Victoria in 2015, spent some time as a postdoc at Northwestern University, and am
				now an Assistant Professor, Teaching Stream at the University of Toronto.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not coming up with new ways to push the boundaries of understanding, I enjoy
				hiking, rock climbing, computer programming, and fiddling with typography.  I'm also
				a huge fan of cooking and love figuring out how to cook with ingredients I've never 
				heard of before!
			</p>

			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<h3>Dynamical Systems</h3>
			<p>
				My mathematical research focuses on <i>dynamical systems</i> and <i>ergodic
				theory</i>.  At its most general, a dynamical system is a
				set and a transformation that moves around points in the set&mdash;for example, think of
				the air molecules on earth (as set) and the wind as it blows them around (as a transformation).
			</p>
			<p>
				The idea of a dynamical system is very general.  It's too general to actually be useful,
				so mathematicians don't study dynamical systems in general.  They study dynamical systems
				with specific properties.  For example, a dynamical system is called <i>mixing</i> if
				any two points eventually end up close to each other.  They may get far apart after that,
				but at some point they must get close.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once properties such as mixing (or a very special property called <i>ergodicity</i>) get
				added to a dynamical system, suddenly you can start proving things about them.
				That's what I do.
			</p>

			<h3>Mathematics Education</h3>
			<p>
				My ultimate goal is to make the world a better place.  Right now I'm working
				on that by teaching people (and sometimes computers) how to use
				mathematics to aid their thinking.  This is hard!  Though mathematics can be fun,
				it doesn't come naturally to most of us&mdash;unlike your tendency to 
				pick up your mother tongue, you don't inevitably stumble into the conclusion
				that <i>when approaching a problem the first thing you should do is write 
					down everything you know</i>.  No,  this is one of the many mathematical
				habits of mind that only comes through training.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to see more about my philosophy of teaching, you can check
				out my <a href="papers/teaching-statement.pdf">Teaching Statement</a>.
				Briefly summarized, I believe you learn by doing, being challenged,
				and forcing your brain to rewire itself.  I am a big proponent of Active Learning,
				Inquiry Based Learning, and the Flipped Classroom (the list could go on and on).
				I am a 2016 MAA Project NeXT Fellow (go green dots!) and a TIMES Linear Algebra Fellow.

				<li>The Mathematical Association of America's <a href="https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/curriculum%20resources/instructional-practices-guide">Instructional Practices Guide</a> has over 100 pages of teaching tips. It is written so that sections can be read in isolation&emdash;you can flip through it randomly.</li>
				<li>The TIMES project's <a href="http://iola.math.vt.edu/">Inquiry Oriented Linear Algebra</a> website</li>
				<li>The <a href="http://www.imagemath.org/">IMAGEmath</a> project introduces real analysis and metric spaces via image denoising,
				differential equations through heat diffusion, and linear algebra through x-ray tomography.</li>
				<li>The <a href="http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/primary-historical-sources-in-the-classroom-discrete-mathematics-and-computer-science">Primary Historical Sources</a> project aims

			<h2>Software</h2>
			<p>
				I always strive to make my life (as well as those around me)
				easier by harnessing the power of the analytic engine to do
				the day's menial tasks.  You can find
				a list of most of my projects on my
				<a href="http://github.com/siefkenj">Github page</a>.  Projects

					<p>
						It currently has several URLs hardcoded to U of T's Canvas implementation, but should be
						easy to change.

						you may plan out a two to four year curriculum and be presented
						with a visual representation of the program in a flow-chart-like
						form.

						CourseMapper is also open-source software.  An unbranded version
						suitable for tailoring to another university's course offerings
